        What actually happens when `deep == False` depends on the
        "copy_on_write" option. When copy-on-write is enabled, a shallow copy
        becomes a deep copy if the buffer has been exposed. This is because we
        have no control over knowing if the data is being modified when the
        buffer has been exposed to third-party.

        Parameters
        ----------
        deep : bool, default True
            The semantics when copy-on-write is disabled:
                - If deep=True, returns a deep copy of the underlying data.
                - If deep=False, returns a shallow copy of the Buffer pointing
                  to the same underlying data.
            The semantics when copy-on-write is enabled:
                - From the users perspective, always a deep copy of the
                  underlying data. However, the data isn't actually copied
                  until someone writers to the returned buffer.

        Returns
        -------
        ExposureTrackedBuffer
            A slice pointing to either a new or the existing owner
            depending on the expose status of the owner and the
            copy-on-write option (see above).
